Hello ADP Progressive Council! If you're new to GitHub, don't worry - I am too. We'll figure this out together.

The three files here are the basis of our website at StopBigMoneyAZ.com. The main one to pay attention to is the .html.

If you want to edit what the website looks like, click on the index.html file and make edits as you see fit. Once you are done, committ the changes to the 'proposed-edits' branch.

DO NOT COMMITT TO MAIN.

To view a preview of the website, committ your proposed edit and the netlify bot will show an option to view preview.

If you have any questions, text Ben at 336-391-0117.
