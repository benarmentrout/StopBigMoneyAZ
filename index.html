      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>
        On <strong>June 7th, 2025</strong>, State Committee Members (SCMs) of the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP) voted overwhelmingly to establish a "People’s Primary" — a bold move to stop billionaires and corporations from buying our primary elections. In the three months since, an ad-hoc committee has drafted the official People's Primary policy to "ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We need your help.</strong> On September 13th, 2025, SCMs will vote on whether or not to officially add the <a href="#peoplesprimary">People's Primary policy</a> into the party bylaws. Please show your support for our final policy by endorsing it using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe61f0KtM_TofiuI0g4ZCCAJ-XMmzHk2bn_WYfgMJ9K6cWCWg/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank">this link.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other state parties like North Carolina, and even the DNC itself, have joined the Arizona Democratic Party in committing to establishing a People's Primary.

    <h3>ARTICLE XVII - PEOPLE'S PRIMARY POLICY</h3>

      <h4>Section 1. Purpose and Authority</h4>
      <p>
        This Article implements the Arizona Democratic Party "Resolution to Establish a 'People's Primary' Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries" passed at the June 7, 2025 State Committee Meeting, to bar, to the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections and ensure Democratic primary candidates are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 2. Scope of Application</h4>
      <p>
        This policy applies to all Democratic primary elections for federal, state, and local offices. It does not apply to general elections.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 3. People's Primary Pledge</h4>
      <h5>3.1 Pledge Requirement</h5>
      <p>
        All Democratic candidates for office must publicly adopt or affirm the People's Primary Pledge within one week of filing for the ballot in a Democratic primary election, and provide evidence of their adoption to the Trustee Committee.
      </p>

      <h5>3.2 Pledge</h5>
      <p>
        The People’s Primary Pledge disavows big money outside spending in our primary elections and commits a candidate to donate the amount of any such spending on their behalf from their campaign fund to a designated charity serving Arizonans in need. The required pledge statement must clearly communicate those commitments, with additional language or justification as chosen by the candidate. Example Pledge language, with mandatory substantial commitments underlined:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "I am proud to take the ADP People's Primary Pledge. <u>I reject big money outside spending on my behalf or to benefit my primary campaign. I will donate the amount of any such spending from my campaign fund to a designated charity serving Arizonans in need.</u> No one who wants to help elect me should violate our People's Primary policy. If you want to help, the best way is to volunteer or donate directly to my campaign. Arizona Democrats don't want billionaires or corporations trying to buy our primary elections. Voters in our state should never doubt: Arizona Democrats are beholden to the people alone."
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Section 4. Definitions</h4>
      <h5>4.1 Big Money Outside Spending or Large Donor Funded Outside Spending</h5>
      <p>
        "Large Donor Funded Outside Spending" means any spending to influence the election by any individual or entity other than the candidate's campaign (including television, radio, digital advertisements, mailers, field operations, or events) which: a) exceeds the Grassroots Threshold; and b) is funded by contributions of more than $5,000 from any individual, corporation, or entity.
      </p>

      <h5>4.2 Grassroots Threshold</h5>
      <p>The "Grassroots Threshold" is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$25,000 for local races</li>
        <li>$50,000 for statewide and federal races</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>4.3 Exclusions</h5>
      <p>
        Spending by a union or membership organization solely for communications with its members is excluded, using existing U.S. Federal Elections Commission (FEC) definitions for "membership organization" and "member."
      </p>

      <h4>Section 5. Self-Funding Limitation</h4>
      <p>
        Candidates in Democratic primaries are prohibited from contributing to their own primary campaign any amount above $15,000 from personal funds.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 6. Charitable Donation Requirement</h4>
      <h5>6.1 Donation Mandate</h5>
      <p>
        Candidates who benefit from Large Donor Funded Outside Spending must donate an amount equal to that spending to the designated charity from their official campaign funds.
      </p>
      <h5>6.2 Clean Elections Exception</h5>
      <p>
        Clean Elections candidates, who are barred by law from donating campaign funds to charity, must instead issue refunds equal to the amount of any Large Donor Funded Outside Spending on their behalf.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 7. Designated Charity Selection</h4>
      <p>
        The designated charity shall be chosen by random selection from up to five charities selected by the People's Primary Trustee Committee or ADP Executive Board. Eligible charities must: (a) be registered as 501(c)(3) organizations in Arizona; (b) be dedicated primarily to providing direct services to Arizonans in need, including people, animals, and environment; (c) not employ or compensate any member of the Trustee Committee or Executive Board, or their direct family members.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 8. Penalties for Non-Compliance</h4>
      <h5>8.1 Failure to Adopt Pledge</h5>
      <p>
        Candidates who fail to adopt the pledge after filing to run shall bear the following penalties until adopting the pledge: (a) immediate termination of VAN access for the remainder of the primary election; (b) ban on participation in all state party-sponsored forums, events, and fundraisers for the remainder of the primary election; (c) ban on formal speaking or leadership participation in all ADP meetings. Penalties will be active for the remainder of the primary election.
      </p>

      <h5>8.2 Failure to Uphold Pledge or Policy</h5>
      <p>
        Candidates who benefit from Large Donor Funded Outside Spending and refuse to donate the required amount to the designated charity within 48 hours of notification of a Trustee Committee finding of a violation or who violate the self-funding limitation shall bear the following penalties: (a) public censure by the ADP; (b) notification by ADP to all registered Democrats eligible to vote in the relevant race of the candidate's failure to uphold the pledge via text message; (c) notification by ADP to all Precinct Committeepersons recommending non-participation with the candidate.
      </p>

      <h5>8.3 Vendor Penalties</h5>
      <p>
        Vendors and firms who design or execute Large Donor Funded Outside Spending shall be (a) ineligible for future ADP contracts for at least 6 years; (b) subject to ADP discouragement for use by candidates and coordinated campaigns; (c) subject to information sharing with other state parties and the DNC regarding violations.
      </p>

      <h5>8.4 Organization and PAC Penalties</h5>
      <p>
        Organizations and PACs engaging in Large Donor Funded Outside Spending in Arizona (or in other states in violation of state Democratic Party policies or in presidential primary elections in violation of Democratic National Committee policies) shall be barred from working with ADP, including participation in coordinated campaigns and field coordination during general elections, for at least 6 years.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 9. Incentives for Compliance</h4>
      <p>
        Candidates who adopt and uphold the pledge shall receive: (a) discounted VAN access; (b) promotion of pledge adoption on ADP social media and to a list of Arizona Democrats who sign up to support candidates who uphold the People’s Primary policy; (c) AZ Dems "People's Primary Candidate" pin and graphics for media use.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 10. Special Circumstances</h4>
      <h5>10.1 Uncontested Primaries</h5>
      <p>
        When a Democratic primary is uncontested due to the voluntary withdrawal or non-filing of all opponents or the absence of any substantive challenge (defined as an opponent who has qualified for Clean Elections funding or, if non-participating, raised at least 30% of the median primary election fundraising totals for the previous two election cycles for Democrats running for that class of seat (e.g. Congressional, state legislature, mayor, etc.), and reached at least 15% in a reputable, independent poll conducted within 90 days before the primary) and the Executive Board certifies by majority vote that no intervention has artificially prevented open and fair competition within the primary election, the remaining candidate may be supported without penalty by unlimited outside spending for the purposes of the general election during the final 60 days before the primary election concludes if they have publicly challenged Republican general election opponents to adopt a similar spending pledge and been refused for at least 14 days. A candidate may request such certification starting 75 days before the primary election concludes and the Executive Board shall vote and decide within 1 week of request. The People’s Primary Trustee Committee Chair shall be a voting participant in Executive Board meetings regarding such certification.
      </p>

      <h5>10.2 Multi-Candidate Race Determination</h5>
      <p>
        In races with three or more candidates, only the primary or intended beneficiary or beneficiaries of qualifying outside spending shall be subject to penalties. For expenditures against a candidate where the intended beneficiary is not explicit, the Trustee Committee shall determine which candidate or candidates are subject to penalties using all available information. In such potential rare cases, the financial penalty may be divided between the multiple candidates assessed to the intended beneficiaries, with the total value of the assessed penalties not exceeding the amount of the qualifying outside spending.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Section 11. People's Primary Trustee Committee</h4>
      <h5>11.1 Composition and Election</h5>
      <p>
        The People's Primary Trustee Committee shall consist of five State Committee Members in good standing, elected by the State Committee for two-year terms, or until the next State Committee Organizational meeting. The Trustee receiving the highest vote total shall serve as Chair [...]
      </p>

      <h5>11.2 Initial Election</h5>
      <p>
        The inaugural Trustee Committee shall be elected at the September 13, 2025 State Committee meeting if this policy is adopted. Subsequent elections shall occur at two-year intervals at the ADP State Organizational Meeting.
      </p>

      <h5>11.3 Replacement Process</h5>
      <p>
        Mid-term replacement due to resignation or failure to attend more than two scheduled meetings shall be made by appointment through simple majority vote of the ADP Executive Board upon recommendation of the Committee.
      </p>

      <h5>11.4 Powers and Duties</h5>
      <p>
        The Trustee Committee shall:  (a) receive and review all violation complaints or reports; (b) notify concerned candidates regarding potential violations upon beginning investigation; (c) issue findings to the ADP Executive Board and ensure enforcement penalties and incentives are carried out; (d) evaluate claims of “false flag” spending designed to harm candidates by triggering penalties; (e) develop administrative interpretation practice and recommend policy adjustments via bylaws amendments to avoid unintended consequences and adapt to changing campaign finance practices or law, while maintaining fidelity to policy intent.
      </p>

      <h5>11.5 Adjustments of Threshold and Limit Dollar Amounts</h5>
      <p>
        Every two years, the Trustee Committee may adjust the dollar amounts of the Grassroots Thresholds, the contribution limit defining Big Money or Large Donor Funded Outside Spending, and the limit for candidate Self-Funding. Any such changes should be made to strengthen the effectiveness of the People’s Primary policy as a tool to achieve its purpose. Any changes may be overturned or altered by majority vote of the State Committee Members.
      </p>

      <h4>Section 12. Enforcement Procedures</h4>
      <h5>12.1 Investigation Timeline</h5>
      <p>
        All violation complaints shall be reviewed within 72 hours, with findings issued to the Executive Board within 72 hours of investigation completion. For complex cases, e.g. those with multiple independent expenditures or disputed beneficiaries, the Trustee Committee may make an initial finding that it requires an extension of the investigation period by up to 120 hours. Investigation and finding timeline requirements may be adjusted by the Trustee Committee after each election cycle, based on accumulated operational experience. Any such changes must support the effective implementation of this policy to achieve its purpose and may be overturned or altered by majority vote of the State Committee Members.
      </p>

      <h5>12.2 Implementation of Penalties</h5>
      <p>
        Upon receiving Trustee Committee findings, the Chair and party staff shall implement established penalties immediately or as soon as possible. The Executive Board may overturn Trustee Committee decisions by majority vote. The Trustee Committee Chair shall participate in and have a vote in Executive Board meetings regarding Trustee Committee findings, appeals, and enforcement.
      </p>

      <h5>12.3 Adjustment of Penalties and Incentives</h5>
      <p>
        Penalties or incentives, and their operational implementation, may be adjusted and additional penalties and incentives may be added by the Trustee Committee after each election cycle, based on accumulated operational experience and assessment of the policy’s effectiveness. Any such changes must support the effective implementation of this policy to achieve its purpose and may be overturned or altered by majority vote of the State Committee Members.
      </p>

      <h5>12.4 Appeals Process</h5>
      <p>
        Candidates may appeal Trustee Committee decisions. During appeals, the Executive Board may, by majority vote, withhold censure for up to fourteen (14) days to schedule an Appeal Meeting. Appeals shall be heard in Executive Session with the candidate's representative present and the Trustee Committee attending. Executive Board decisions on appeals are final for the election cycle and shall be conducted under Robert's Rules unless otherwise restricted by ADP bylaws.

      <h5>12.5 Censure Process</h5>
      <p>
        Standardized censure shall consist of: (a) Within 72 hours of violation determination, a statement signed by the Chair and Executive Board; (b) Immediate press release to major Arizona news agencies, publication on all ADP social media platforms, and email distribution to all Precinct Committee Members and the candidate; c) Recording by the ADP Secretary and prominent publication on the ADP website for the duration of the election cycle.

    <h2>The Resolution</h2>
    <p><strong>Resolution passed by the Arizona State Democratic Party on June 7th, 2025</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Resolution to Establish a “People’s Primary” Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Democratic Party is the party of the working class and Americans who believe in a one person, one vote democracy where our elections are determined by We the People as equal citizens –– not billionaires and big corporations; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, working class voters should have no doubt that the candidates chosen in our primaries are not beholden to the same billionaires and corporations that are exploiting and hurting them; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP), as a voluntary association, has the authority and responsibility to regulate its internal affairs, including nominating processes and primary elections, to ensure fairness, integrity, and alignment with our values; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, to strengthen our party’s brand, win back trust from many voters, and empower our party to win elections and govern to deliver for the working class, the Arizona Democratic Party must act to confront the crisis of big money corrupting our democracy within the arena under our direct authority: our primary elections;</p>
    <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong> that the Arizona Democratic Party will establish a "People's Primary" policy to bar, to the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections. This policy will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.</p>
    <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong> that the Chair of the ADP Rules Committee shall form an ad-hoc committee to develop this policy that includes the organizers of this resolution and one mutually-agreed member of the ADP Executive Committee. The committee will be charged with developing this policy to achieve the purpose established here-in and with formulating official proposed ADP People's Primary policy and procedures, including any bylaws changes, if necessary, to implement and enforce it. This policy and associated procedures, and any additional supporting resolution or bylaws changes, will be prepared and submitted for a vote at the September 2025 State Committee Meeting.</p>

  <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Stop Big Money AZ</strong> campaign is a project of a grassroots coalition of Arizona Democrats committed to building a party that puts the working class first, not billionaires and big corporations. The coalition is helmed by the <strong>Arizona Democratic Party Progressive Council</strong>, which is the largest Caucus or Council in the Arizona Democratic Party with over 150 members. We are united by the mission to bring the progressive values of our communities to the state legislature and beyond, to create the Arizona and United States of America we all deserve.
