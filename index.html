      <p>
        On <strong>June 7th, 2025</strong>, State Committee Members of the Arizona Democratic Party will vote on a proposal to establish a "People’s Primary" — a bold move to stop billionaires and corporations from buying our primaries. This resolution is about taking back power for working-class Arizonans and ensuring our democracy works for <em>everyone</em>, not just the wealthiest few.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We need your help.</strong> Before June 7th, please <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0cGUVtUrib9rtX-fADTSAqFnEOkWy4wkZ9E-WUEYEvRhiDg/viewform" target="_blank">endorse this resolution</a></strong> and <strong>share it with your friends, allies, and fellow Democrats</strong>. Let’s build a wave of grassroots support to make sure our voices are louder than big money.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    
      <h3>The Research is Clear</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Big Money pushes politics rightward.</strong> Removing bans on outside spending boosts Republican success and makes state legislatures more conservative. (Abdul-Razzak et al., 2017)</li>
        <li><strong>Voters hate Big Money.</strong> 77% of Americans support limits on campaign spending. When people believe money controls politics, they feel unheard and disengage. (Pew Research Center, 2018; Haenschen et al., 2024; Schnakenberg et al., 2023)</li>
        <li><strong>Big Money breaks our party and our government.</strong> Outside spending fragments coalitions and undermines effective governance in legislatures. (Norton & Pildes, 2020; Manento, 2019)</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Big Money is Here in Arizona</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nearly 60% of ads in 2022 Democratic House primaries</strong> were funded by outside groups, not candidates.</li>
        <li><strong>In 2012, just 159 donors gave $1 million or more</strong> — accounting for nearly 60% of all Super PAC funding nationwide.</li>
        <li><strong>$1.1 million in the 2024 AZ-01 Primary:</strong> Amish Shah won after the primary, then lost the general.</li>
        <li><strong>$5.3 million in the 2024 AZ-03 Primary:</strong> Yassamin Ansari edged out Raquel Terán by 39 votes, helped by $1.3 million from crypto super PACs.</li>
        <li><strong>$839,000 in the 2018 AZ-02 Primary:</strong> Ann Kirkpatrick relocated districts and won with heavy Super PAC support.</li>
        <li><strong>$257,000 in the 2012 AZ-09 Primary:</strong> Kyrsten Sinema triumphed with help from big-money allies.</li>
        <li><strong>$354,000 in the 2020 LD2 & LD3 Primaries:</strong> 79% of outside spending went to two candidates.</li>
        <li><strong>$1.5 million in the 2019 Tucson Mayoral Primary:</strong></li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>
        These aren’t anomalies. They are symptoms of a broken system — one where billionaires and special interests treat Arizona’s primaries as playgrounds. If we want to restore trust, build a party that works for the people, and win elections up and down the ballot, we must confront the influence of big money now.

    <h2>Our Resolution</h2>
    <p><strong>Resolution for Submission to the Arizona State Democratic Party</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Resolution to Establish a “People’s Primary” Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Democratic Party is the party of the working class and Americans who believe in a one person, one vote democracy where our elections are determined by We the People as equal citizens –– not billionaires and big corporations; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, working class voters should have no doubt that the candidates chosen in our primaries are not beholden to the same billionaires and corporations that are exploiting and hurting them; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP), as a voluntary association, has the authority and responsibility to regulate its internal affairs, including nominating processes and primary elections, to ensure fairness, integrity, and alignment with our values; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, to strengthen our party’s brand, win back trust from many voters, and empower our party to win elections and govern to deliver for the working class, the Arizona Democratic Party must act to confront the crisis of big money corrupting our democracy within the arena under our direct authority: our primary elections;</p>
    <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong> that the Arizona Democratic Party will establish a "People's Primary" policy to bar, to the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections. This policy will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.</p>
    <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong> that the Chair of the ADP Rules Committee shall form an ad-hoc committee to develop this policy that includes the organizers of this resolution and one mutually-agreed member of the ADP Executive Committee. The committee will be charged with developing this policy to achieve the purpose established here-in and with formulating official proposed ADP People's Primary policy and procedures, including any bylaws changes, if necessary, to implement and enforce it. This policy and associated procedures, and any additional supporting resolution or bylaws changes, will be prepared and submitted for a vote at the September 2025 State Committee Meeting.</p>
