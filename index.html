      <p>
        On <strong>June 7th, 2025</strong>, State Committee Members (SCMs) of the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP) voted overwhelmingly to establish a "People’s Primary" — a bold move to stop billionaires and corporations from buying our primary elections. In the months since, an ad-hoc committee has drafted the official People's Primary policy to "ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We need your help.</strong> We need your help. On January 24th, 2026, SCMs may vote on whether or not to adopt the People's Primary policy for the ADP as a pilot program. If you are an Arizona Democrat, please show your support for the policy by talking to Dem State Committee Members and Dem primary candidates in your district. We encourage everyone to read the policy for themselves to understand it clearly and to review the very encouraging results of this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_CR1tDAzIoas77Xs3pcmpUMfB-pHwWK/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">statewide poll of Arizona voters about it.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other state parties like North Carolina, New Mexico and even the DNC itself, have joined the Arizona Democratic Party in committing to enact reforms like the People's Primary. Want your state to be next? <a href="mailto:azdemprogressivecouncil@gmail.com">Contact us</a> and we will connect you with our network of organizers and resources to help you along the way.

    <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnRXeBDb4nj_hjQdhfwl9HuivDmXSaAAl3jqao4LZPg">The People's Primary</a></h2>
    <!--
    <i>The People’s Primary policy is being presented for a vote at the January 24th, 2026, State Committee Meeting as a party policy rather than a bylaws change. Like the Code of Conduct policy adopted by the Executive Board and the Conflict of Interest policy adopted by the executive committee, this policy would not be encoded as bylaws. As a pilot program proposed for the 2026 election cycle, this policy is not now appropriate to be enshrined as permanent bylaws. Given the consequential character of this policy and in keeping with the direction of the June 7th resolution, this policy is proposed to be enacted by a vote of the full state committee, the highest governing body of the party, rather than the executive board or executive committee. Further, we assess that no bylaws changes are necessary to enact or enforce this policy.</i>
    <h3>PEOPLE'S PRIMARY POLICY</h3>
    <h4>Section 1. Purpose and Authority</h4>
    <p>
      This Article implements the Arizona Democratic Party "Resolution to Establish a 'People's Primary' Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries" passed at the June 7, 2025 State Committee Meeting, to bar, to the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections and ensure Democratic primary candidates are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 2. Scope and Duration of Application</h4>
    <p>
      This policy applies to Democratic primary elections in districts and jurisdictions that are rated safe or solid for Democrats according to partisan voter index score as assessed by the Ad Hoc Committee and informed by expert consultation. For congressional races, Cook Political Report rankings are used. The policy does not apply to statewide races. A full list of districts, jurisdictions, or races where the policy does NOT apply shall be made available prior to the January 24th State Committee meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy is a pilot program for the 2026 election cycle. It enters into effect on February 1st, 2026. It is not retroactive and no penalties will be enforced for violations which may have occurred prior to that date.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 3. People's Pledge</h4>
    
    <h5>3.1 Pledge Requirement</h5>
    <p>
      All Democratic candidates running for office in covered races must publicly adopt or affirm the People's Pledge within one week of notification by the Trustee Committee or its representatives or one week of filing nomination petitions to qualify for the ballot in their Democratic primary election, whichever comes first, and provide evidence of their adoption to the Trustee Committee.
    </p>
    
    <h5>3.2 Pledge</h5>
    <p>
      The People’s Pledge rejects big money outside spending or independent expenditures in our primary elections and commits a candidate to donate half of the value of any such spending on their behalf from their campaign fund to a designated charity serving Arizonans in need. The required pledge statement must clearly communicate the following substantial commitments using the words of a candidate’s choice, with any additional justification or explanation as chosen by the candidate:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      "I am taking the People's Pledge. I reject big money outside spending on my behalf or to benefit my primary campaign. I will donate half of the amount of any such spending from my campaign fund to a designated charity serving Arizonans in need."
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Section 4. Definitions</h4>
    
    <h5>4.1 Big Money Outside Spending or Large Donor Funded Outside Spending or Independent Expenditures</h5>
    <p>
      "Large Donor Funded Outside Spending" means any spending to influence the election by any individual or entity other than the candidate's campaign (including television, radio, digital advertisements, mailers, field operations, or events) which: (a) exceeds the Grassroots Threshold; and (b) is funded by contributions of more than $5,000 from any individual, corporation, or entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For organizations which receive donations above $5,000 but wish to carry out independent expenditure campaigns in Democratic primary elections which comply with this policy, they must create a segregated account for the funding of the independent expenditure which will only receive contributions of $5,000 or less and voluntarily disclose their contribution sources and amounts whether required by law or not. Independent expenditures above the Grassroots Threshold which do not disclose contribution sources and amounts will be presumed to be in violation until and unless contribution sources and amounts are disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Outside Spending” and “Independent Expenditure” are exchangeable terms in this document.
    </p>
    
    <h5>4.2 Grassroots Threshold</h5>
    <p>The "Grassroots Threshold" is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$25,000 for local races</li>
      <li>$50,000 for non-statewide federal races</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>4.3 Exclusions</h5>
    <p>
      Spending by a union or membership organization solely for communications with its members is excluded, using existing U.S. Federal Elections Commission (FEC) definitions for "membership organization" and "member."
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 5. Self-Funding Limitation</h4>
    <p>
      Candidates in covered races are prohibited from contributing to their own primary campaign any amount above $15,000 from personal funds.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 6. Charitable Donation Requirement</h4>
    
    <h5>6.1 Donation Mandate</h5>
    <p>
      Candidates in covered races who benefit from Large Donor Funded Outside Spending must donate an amount equal to half of the value of that spending to the designated charity from their official campaign funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mandatory donation amount is greater than the total campaign funds of a candidate, the candidate is not obligated to donate anything beyond their available campaign funds. However, if and when they raise additional funds they will be obligated to complete the remainder of the mandatory donation immediately until the full amount is met.
    </p>
    
    <h5>6.2 Clean Elections Exception</h5>
    <p>
      Clean Elections candidates, who are barred by law from donating campaign funds to charity, must instead return amounts equal to half of the value of any Large Donor Funded Outside Spending on their behalf to the Clean Elections Fund.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 7. Designated Charity Selection</h4>
    <p>
      The designated charity shall be chosen by random selection from up to five charities chosen by the ADP Executive Board after referral by the Trustee Committee within four weeks of adoption of this policy. Eligible charities must: (a) be registered as 501(c)(3) organizations in Arizona; (b) be dedicated primarily to providing direct services to Arizonans in need, including people, animals, and environment; (c) not employ or compensate any member of the Trustee Committee or Executive Board, or their direct family members.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 8. Penalties for Non-Compliance</h4>
    
    <h5>8.1 Failure to Adopt Pledge</h5>
    <p>
      Candidates who fail to adopt the pledge according to Section 3.1 shall bear the following penalties until adopting the pledge: (a) immediate termination of VAN access for the remainder of the primary election; (b) ban on participation in all state party-sponsored forums, events, and fundraisers for the remainder of the primary election; (c) ban on formal speaking or leadership participation in all ADP meetings. Penalties will be active until the deadline for ballot curing in their primary election has passed or all other candidates have conceded to a winner.
    </p>
    
    <h5>8.2 Failure to Uphold Pledge or Policy</h5>
    <p>
      Candidates who benefit from Large Donor Funded Outside Spending and fail to donate the required amount to the designated charity within 48 hours of notification by the Trustee Committee or who violate the self-funding limitation shall be subject to the following penalties: (a) public censure by the ADP; (b) direct notification regarding the censure via ADP email to all Precinct Committeepersons in the district or jurisdiction wherein the candidate is running and in the county or counties where the district or jurisdiction lies.
    </p>
    
    <h5>8.3 Vendor Penalties</h5>
    <p>
      Vendors and firms who design or execute Large Donor Funded Outside Spending on behalf of Democratic primary candidates in violation of this policy may be denied future ADP contracts and the ADP may discourage their use by Arizona candidates and coordinated campaigns and other state parties and the DNC. Any such violations will be reported to the State Committee by the Trustee Committee.
    </p>
    
    <h5>8.4 Organization and PAC Penalties</h5>
    <p>
      Organizations and PACs engaging in Large Donor Funded Outside Spending on behalf of Democratic primary candidates in violation of this policy (or in other states in violation of state Democratic Party policies or in presidential primary elections in violation of Democratic National Committee policies) may be barred from working with the ADP, including participation in coordinated campaigns and field coordination during general elections. Any such violations will be reported to the State Committee by the Trustee Committee.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 9. Incentives for Compliance</h4>
    <p>
      Candidates who adopt and uphold the pledge shall receive: (a) discounted VAN access, as determined appropriate to types of races; (b) promotion of pledge adoption on ADP social media and to a list of Democrats and donors who sign up to support candidates who uphold the People’s Primary policy; (c) AZ Dems "People's Primary Candidate" pin and graphics for media use.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 10. Special Circumstances</h4>
    
    <h5>10.1 Multi-Candidate Race Determination</h5>
    <p>
      In races with three or more candidates, only the primary or intended beneficiary or beneficiaries of qualifying outside spending shall be subject to the donation requirement in Section 6 and penalties for non-compliance in Section 8.2. For expenditures against a candidate where the intended beneficiary is not explicit, the Trustee Committee shall determine which candidate or candidates are subject to the donation requirement using all available information. In such potential rare cases, the donation requirement may be divided between multiple candidates assessed to be intended beneficiaries, with the total value of the assessed donation requirement not exceeding the amount of the qualifying outside spending. If no reasonable determination can be made, a donation requirement may not be assessed.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 11. People's Primary Trustee Committee</h4>
    
    <h5>11.1 Composition and Election</h5>
    <p>
      The People's Primary Trustee Committee shall consist of five State Committee Members in good standing, elected by the State Committee at the January 24th meeting after the adoption of this policy and serving until the January 2027 State Committee meeting. The Chair of the Trustee Committee will be chosen by majority vote of its members.
    </p>
    
    <h5>11.2 Replacement Process</h5>
    <p>
      Mid-term replacement due to resignation or failure to attend more than two scheduled meetings shall be made by appointment through simple majority vote of the ADP Executive Board upon recommendation of the Committee.
    </p>
    
    <h5>11.3 Powers and Duties</h5>
    <p>
      The Trustee Committee shall: (a) receive and review all violation complaints or reports; (b) notify concerned candidates regarding potential violations upon beginning investigation; (c) issue findings to the ADP Executive Board and ensure enforcement penalties and incentives are carried out; (d) evaluate claims of “false flag” spending designed to harm candidates by triggering penalties; (e) develop administrative interpretation practice and recommend policy adjustments to avoid unintended consequences and adapt to changing campaign finance practices or law, while maintaining fidelity to policy intent.
    </p>
    
    <h5>11.4 Notification, Public Promotion, and Education</h5>
    <p>
      The Trustee Committee will work with party staff, the Chair and Executive Board, and volunteers to notify candidates, promote public education regarding the People’s Primary policy, and create resources for candidates, organizations, and vendors to support compliance.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Section 12. Enforcement Procedures</h4>
    
    <h5>12.1 Investigation Timeline</h5>
    <p>
      All violation complaints shall be reviewed within 72 hours, with findings issued to the Executive Board within 72 hours of investigation completion. For complex cases, the Trustee Committee may extend the investigation period by up to 120 hours.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.2 Implementation of Penalties</h5>
    <p>
      Upon receiving Trustee Committee findings, the Chair and party staff shall implement established penalties immediately or as soon as possible. The Executive Board may overturn Trustee Committee decisions by majority vote. No candidate penalties shall be imposed after the ballot curing deadline for the primary election has passed or all other candidates have conceded to a winner.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.3 Appeals Process</h5>
    <p>
      Candidates, vendors, and organizations may appeal Trustee Committee decisions. Appeals shall be heard in Executive Session. Executive Board decisions on appeals are final for the election cycle.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.4 Enforcement Approach</h5>
    <p>
      The intent of this policy is first to prevent potential violations and second to enable effective enforcement consequences in response to willful and consequential violations, not inadvertent or minor violations.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.5 Censure Process</h5>
    <p>
      Standardized censure shall consist of a signed statement, immediate press release and publication, and recording and publication on the ADP website for the duration of the election cycle.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.6 Final Month Expedited Process</h5>
    <p>
      During the final month of the primary, investigations, findings, and appeals shall be expedited to the greatest extent possible.
    </p>
    
    <h5>12.7 Candidate Self-Compliance</h5>
    <p>
      Candidates are strongly encouraged to negotiate mutually agreed procedures with their opponents to ensure compliance with pledges and address potential violations.

    <h2>The Resolution</h2>
    <p><strong>Resolution passed by the Arizona State Democratic Party on June 7th, 2025</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Resolution to Establish a “People’s Primary” Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Democratic Party is the party of the working class and Americans who believe in a one person, one vote democracy where our elections are determined by We the People as equal citizens –– not billionaires and big corporations; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, working class voters should have no doubt that the candidates chosen in our primaries are not beholden to the same billionaires and corporations that are exploiting and hurting them; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP), as a voluntary association, has the authority and responsibility to regulate its internal affairs, including nominating processes and primary elections, to ensure fairness, integrity, and alignment with our values; and</p>
    <p>WHEREAS, to strengthen our party’s brand, win back trust from many voters, and empower our party to win elections and govern to deliver for the working class, the Arizona Democratic Party must act to confront the crisis of big money corrupting our democracy within the arena under our direct authority: our primary elections;</p>
    <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong> that the Arizona Democratic Party will establish a "People's Primary" policy to bar, to the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections. This policy will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefited by, dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate’s campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.</p>
    <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong> that the Chair of the ADP Rules Committee shall form an ad-hoc committee to develop this policy that includes the organizers of this resolution and one mutually-agreed member of the ADP Executive Committee. The committee will be charged with developing this policy to achieve the purpose established here-in and with formulating official proposed ADP People's Primary policy and procedures, including any bylaws changes, if necessary, to implement and enforce it. This policy and associated procedures, and any additional supporting resolution or bylaws changes, will be prepared and submitted for a vote at the September 2025 State Committee Meeting.</p>
